// Hardcoded UID for the current user session context (from previous logs ideally, but user must authenticate)
// Since this runs in node, we need to bypass or mockauth. 
// Actually, this script is intended to be run IN THE BROWSER CONSOLE or via a temporary UI button.
// For safety, I'll create a simple React Component "ResetButton" temporary or just instructions.

// BETTER: I will create a temporary file `cleanup_script.js` that the user can run via node if they have admin SDK, but they don't.
// I'll create a `debug_cleanup.js` file that I can ask the user to Paste into their browser console or I can just modify Dashboard to include a "Reset" button for this session.

console.log("To reset the dashboard manually:");
console.log("1. Go to Firestore Console");
console.log("2. Delete documents in 'workouts' collection with today's date.");

// Since I am the agent, I can auto-run a cleanup if I integrate it into the app via a temporary useEffect.
// I'll append a temporary cleanup logic to Dashboard.jsx that runs ONCE.
